# Morning Meeting App
A classroom morning meeting app built using React!

## Description
This app was a project built using React. As an educator working in a elementary special education ILC classroom, I wanted an app that contained all of the materials and tools needed to run the start of our class' morning meeting so that everything could run seamlessly and be located in one place. The app is responsive and has some neat interactive elements.

While trying to get a static site deployed to GitHub, I ran into difficulties deploying a static vite react site. I found the best help to be a tutorial video. I was able to get a live site up but still ran into a bug that brought a user to a separate page that didn't have a route on my app. The user would have to manually go to the home page.
